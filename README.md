Repository to hold some python scripts that I've been working as I've done some courses 

Change_Color_Of_An_Image:

Attention: Needs to be improved asking for some input for the image and the font. CUrrently the path needs to be set manually.

The script takes an image and a font, and creates a sheet 3x3 of the image modified. We also add some text that shows how much is that image modified.

An example of this is:

<img width="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/jaumeVallsBota/Python_scripts/assets/150121531/c1d1e9b1-7994-408e-a22e-7b77c7422d72">


DetectFaceInImages.py

The script takes an image (in the example used, newspaper image), and it shows the faces found in the newspaper image in case one of the given words is found in the text of the newspaper.

Q_and_A_for_a_document.py

contains the code to read a PDF document, and will answer to the questions about the document that you want to ask. Also, it contains some piece of code that creates automatically some questions from the document and answers back. Once this is done, an evaluation of the answers is provided to see if the AI is answering right
